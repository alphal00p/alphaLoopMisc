(`1a6a8b17123c75fad0a415f3708f74d7e58be359` is the version our results where ran from, but a more recent revision of that branch may work as well)

Then because the UFO model loop_qcd_qed_sm_Gmu_3FS for charm final state is not online, you must copy it to your madgraph folder, i.e.

mv ../loop_qcd_qed_sm_Gmu_3FS ./models/

Finally, when you use this version/branch of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, make sure to cite arXiv:2504.10104 on top of the standard ones (arXiv:1405.0301,arXiv:1804.10017).
